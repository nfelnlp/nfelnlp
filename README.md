### :wave: Hi there
I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at the [Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning](https://www.bifold.berlin/) and the Technische Universität Berlin (graduating early 2025) advised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Sebastian Möller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/), affiliated with the [XplaiNLP](https://www.tu.berlin/en/qu/ueber-uns/team-personen/senior-researchers/nils-feldhus) group as a Senior Researcher as well as with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) as a guest researcher.
Between 2020 and 2024, I was a software engineer at the [Speech and Language Technology](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology/) department of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Berlin and part of the [European Language Grid](https://live.european-language-grid.eu/) technical team from January 2020 to March 2021.  

### :telescope: Research
My main research interest is the interpretability of language models with the goal of increasing the trust and reliability for users and simplifying access to explanations. Other topics include rationale generation, text simplification and summarization, dialogue systems, biomedical and clinical NLP, and evaluation measures for model-generated text.

My publications are listed [on my homepage](https://nfelnlp.github.io/) and [on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nM50iv8AAAAJ).
